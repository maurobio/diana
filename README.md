 An interactive environment for [DELTA](http://delta-intkey.com/) (*DEscription Language for TAxonomy*)

DIANA for Windows is a software management system which brings together the DELTA programs under the Microsoft Windows operating environment, where the user can edit data or directive files, run the Linux or Windows versions of the DELTA programs (CONFOR, KEY and DIST) and view/edit/print the results - all this with a few keystrokes or mouse clicks. Behind it the normal DELTA programs work and run as before - except that instead of invoking them one-by-one, you can now do a complete analysis of a taxonomic dataset, from data-checking to key construction, with a mouse and a graphical user interface!

DIANA is a stand-alone program written using [Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org/)/[Lazarus](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/), and features:

⦁	A built-in ASCII text editor, supporting the editing of multiple data or directives DELTA files through one or more moveable, resizeable, overlapping windows in a Multiple Document Interface, and able to handle large amounts  of text, limited only by available memory;

⦁	Syntax highlighting in the editor - DELTA language elements (e.g., directives, identifiers) are highlighted with different colors.
